            <p>This time I was invited by <strong>Jonas Basten</strong> to join the podcast <strong>FounderFlow</strong>, which focuses on the ups and downs of startup life.</p>
            <p>We talked about HR in startups, how we hire and grow the team at SONAH, and what I’ve learned over the years while building and leading a company.</p>
            <p>It was an awesome experience — I really loved how Jonas got me to talk about topics and share insights that were hard for me to formulate before.</p>
            <p>I will embed the video via a YouTube proxy, so that your data is not tracked before you decide to watch it.</p>

            <p>In the early summer I was asked by a student from RWTH Aachen, Chandandeep Singh, to take part in this
                podcast.</p>
            <p>He is doing a podcast about people who's culture it is to build things. I think that fitted perfectly to
                me and it was a lot of fun to talk about my lifestory (if you can call it that) and my professional
                experiences, as well as my philosophies.</p>
            <p>I was really impressed by his professionalism and how well prepared the podcast was prepared! In addition
                to that I had listened to other episodes of his podcast (after I became aware that it existed) and I
                must say I really liked them and was impressed by the amount of helpful information in this "amature"
                podcast.</p>
            <p>In this part of the podcast (I guess more are to come) it's only about my career, how it started and
                where I am now.</p>
            <p>I will embed this video via youtube proxy, so that your data is not tracked even before you watched the
